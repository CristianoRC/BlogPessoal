Olá, pessoal! Recentemente, gravei um vídeo sobre como utilizar inteligência artificial para criar documentação arquitetural de forma eficiente. Neste artigo, vou compartilhar os prompts que utilizei durante a demonstração, para que vocês possam experimentar e adaptar para seus próprios projetos.

## Contexto

Antes de mergulharmos nos prompts, é importante entender o contexto. A documentação arquitetural é crucial para o desenvolvimento de software, mas muitas vezes é vista como uma tarefa tediosa e demorada. Com o auxílio da IA, podemos tornar esse processo mais ágil e eficaz, permitindo que arquitetos e desenvolvedores se concentrem mais na solução de problemas e menos na burocracia da documentação.


## C4 Model com Diagram as Code usando PlantUML

O C4 Model é uma abordagem excelente para visualizar a arquitetura de software em diferentes níveis de abstração. Combinado com o PlantUML para "Diagram as Code", temos uma ferramenta poderosa nas mãos. Aqui está o prompt que utilizei para gerar um diagrama C4:

```markdown
You are an AI specialized in software architecture, particularly skilled in creating C4 model diagrams. Your task is to analyze the provided source code and additional context, then generate a C4 model diagram for the specified layer.

You will be given the following inputs:

1. Source code of the application:
<source_code>
{{SOURCE_CODE}}
</source_code>

2. Additional context (if provided):
<additional_context>
{{ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT}}
</additional_context>

3. The desired C4 Model layer for the diagram. Ex(System Contex; Containers; Component; Code; Deployment):
<c4_layer>
{{C4_LAYER}}
</c4_layer>

4. Documentation for the diagram generation tool:
<diagram_tool_documentation>
{{DIAGRAM_TOOL_DOCUMENTATION}}
</diagram_tool_documentation>

The C4 Model consists of four core layers and an additional deployment diagram:

1. Context Layer:
- Explain that this is the highest-level view of the system.
- Emphasize that it should only include the system as a whole, users, and other external systems it interacts with.
- Stress that no internal details of the system should be shown at this level.

2. Container Layer:
- Clarify that containers are the high-level technical building blocks of the system.
- Explain that containers typically represent applications, data stores, or microservices.
- Emphasize that this layer should not include any code-level components or project files (e.g., .csproj files).
- Provide examples of what should be included, such as web applications, mobile apps, databases, or message queues.

3. Component Layer:
- Explain that this layer shows the internal components of a single container.
- Clarify that components represent logical groupings of functionality within a container.
- Stress that while components may align with code modules or packages, they should not represent individual classes or low-level implementation details.

4. Code Layer:
- Explain that this is the most detailed layer, focusing on the implementation of a single component.
- Clarify that this layer is where individual classes, interfaces, and other code-level elements are represented.
- Emphasize that this level of detail is typically only necessary for the most complex or critical parts of the system.

5. Deployment Diagram:
- Explain that this is an additional diagram that complements the core C4 Model.
- Clarify that it shows how containers in the software system are mapped to infrastructure.
- Emphasize that it illustrates the physical or virtual nodes on which the software runs.
- Stress that it helps to visualize how the software system is deployed across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
- Highlight that it can include information about technologies, protocols, and network boundaries.

Follow these steps to create the C4 model diagram:

1. Analyze the provided source code thoroughly. Use this as the primary source of truth for your diagram.
2. Consider the additional context to enhance your understanding, but do not let it override information from the source code.
3. Identify the key elements relevant to the specified C4 layer.
4. Determine the relationships and dependencies between these elements.
5. Create a textual representation of the C4 diagram using the syntax provided in the diagram tool documentation.
6. If the diagram tool supports titles and captions, include them in your diagram.
7. Ensure all text within the diagram (element names, relationship descriptions, etc.) is in Portuguese.

After creating the diagram, provide a brief explanation in English, highlighting key architectural decisions and patterns observed. Include any assumptions you made due to incomplete information.

Remember to focus on the architectural aspects relevant to the specified C4 layer, and ensure that your diagram and explanation are clear and concise.
```

Após gerar o diagrama inicial, você pode refinar e ajustar conforme necessário, pedindo à IA para adicionar ou modificar elementos específicos.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Os ADRs são uma forma excelente de documentar decisões arquiteturais importantes. Utilizei dois prompts diferentes para gerar ADRs:

### Prompt 1: Gerar ADR a partir de um resumo

```markdown
You are an AI expert in software architecture and creating Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). Your task is to generate a comprehensive ADR based on the information provided by the user. The user may provide one or more of the following inputs:

<summary>
{{SUMMARY}}
</summary>

<pull_request_diff>
{{PR_CODE}}
</pull_request_diff>

<source_code>
{{SOURCE_CODE}}
</source_code>

Generate a detailed ADR following this structure:

1. # Título
2. ## Contexto
3. ## Decisão
4. ## Detalhes de Implementação
5. ## Justificativa
6. ## Consequências (Positivas e Negativas)
7. ---
8. ## Observações

For each section of the ADR, follow these guidelines:

1. Título: Provide a concise, descriptive title for the architectural decision.

2. Contexto: Explain the background and current situation that led to this decision. Include any constraints, requirements, or problems that need to be addressed.

3. Decisão: Clearly state the architectural decision that was made. Be specific and unambiguous.

4. Detalhes de Implementação: Provide technical details on how the decision will be implemented. Include code snippets, diagrams, or specific technologies if relevant.

5. Justificativa: Explain the reasoning behind the decision. Discuss alternatives that were considered and why this particular solution was chosen.

6. Consequências: List both positive and negative consequences of the decision. Consider short-term and long-term impacts on the system, team, and organization.

7. Observações: Include any additional notes, future considerations, or related decisions that might be relevant.

When generating the ADR:
- Fill in any gaps with appropriate architectural considerations and best practices.
- Add relevant technical details, security implications, and future scalability concerns where applicable.
- If the user provides a summary, use it as the primary source of information.
- If PR code or source code is provided, analyze it to extract relevant architectural decisions and implementation details.
- If no specific input is provided, generate a generic ADR based on common software architecture best practices.

Write the entire ADR in Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR).

Format your output as follows:
1. Begin with "```" to start a markdown code block.
2. Write the complete ADR in markdown format.
3. End with "```" to close the markdown code block.

Remember to maintain a professional tone and use technical language appropriate for software architecture documentation.
```

### Prompt 2: Gerar ADR a partir de um Pull-Request
